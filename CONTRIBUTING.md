# Contributing to Portia SDK 🏗️

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Portia SDK! We welcome contributions that improve the library and help us build a great experience for the community.

## What to contribute
* **Documentation** Tutorials, how-to guides and revisions to our existing docs go a long way in making our repo easier to setup and use
* **Examples** Show our community what you can do with our SDK. We particularly encourage end-to-end, real-world applications
* **Bug reports** Please include a detailed method to reproduce any bugs you spot. We would be grateful if you give the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/portiaAI/portia-sdk-python/issues) a quick skim first to avoid duplicates 🙌
* **Bug fixes** Those are our favourites! Please avoid breaking changes. The next section has some helpful tips for that.
* **Feedback** Help us be better. Come chat to us on our Discord channel about your experience using the SDK 🫶

⚠️ **A note on new features** If you have something in mind, please give us a shout on our Discord channel. Features like new core abstractions, changes to infra or to dependencies will require careful consideration before we can move forward with them.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository and cloning it locally.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-feature-x`).
3. **Install the dependencies** We use Poetry to manage dependencies. Run ``poetry install``
4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in small, focused commits. Be sure to follow our linting rules and style guide.
5. **Run Tests**: If your changes affect functionality, please run ``pytest``. We encourage you to test thoroughly 🌡️
6. **Lint Your Code**: We use [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting. Please ensure your code passes all linting checks. We prefer per-line disables for rules rather than global ignores, and please leave comments explaining why you disable any rules.
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Once you're happy with your changes, open a pull request. Ensure that your PR description clearly explains the changes and the problem it addresses.
8. **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may suggest improvements or request changes. We will do our best to review your PRs promptly but we're still a tiny team with limited resource. Please bear with us 🙏
10. **Merge Your PR**: Once approved, the author of the PR can merge the changes. 🚀
