Whispers of the Earth

Beneath the sky's eternal dome,
Where rivers sing and wild winds roam,
The Earth adorns her emerald dress,
A breath of calm, a sweet caress.

The mountains rise with noble grace,
Snow-crowned kings in silent space,
Guardians of the dawn’s first light,
Blushing gold in morning’s sight.

The forest hums a gentle song,
Where ancient trees have stood so long,
Each leaf a verse, each root a line,
A testament to life’s design.

The ocean speaks in rhythmic tide,
Its secrets in the deep reside,
Reflecting stars in midnight's hue,
A mirror for the dreaming blue.

Petals burst in spring’s delight,
Kissed by bees in morning light,
While birds compose their airborne rhyme,
A fleeting art untouched by time.

In every breeze, in every flame,
Nature calls us by our name—
To see, to feel, to stand in awe,
And learn again her sacred law.
