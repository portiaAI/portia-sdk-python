Ballad of the Laser-Sharks
Beneath the waves where shadows glide,
Where ocean secrets love to hide,
There lurks a force both fierce and stark—
The dreaded, mighty laser-shark.
Its dorsal fin, a gleaming ray,
Can turn the darkest depths to day.
With eyes aglow, a crimson spark,
Beware the beam of laser-shark.
Coral castles quake in fear,
Whales fall silent when it nears.
No submarine nor steel-clad ark
Escapes the wrath of laser-shark.
Yet some say deep within its soul,
It dreams of peace, a gentler goal.
A predator, yet oddly smart,
With aching heart—the laser-shark.
So sing this tale when seas grow black,
And hope you never cross its track.
For legends whisper, cold and stark:
The sea belongs to laser-shark.
